        <h1>F.A.Qs about GO LIVE</h1>
        <p>To <b>Go Live</b>, your game needs to be recognized by our built-in game detection system and you need to be actively viewing a server! When your game is detected, the <b>Go Live</b> tab will appear on the bottom left of your screen, above your status bar.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Great! Now that you’ve got your game detected, go ahead and click the <b>Go Live</b> button. A window will then pop-up and you can select a voice channel. It'll look like this:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/111.png" />
        </p>
        <p>And you are LIVE now. You should see a small Picture-in-Picture (PiP) window of the game you're sharing so you can check out how it looks!</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Go_Live_PiP_Window_copy.png" style="width: 668px;height: 319px;" />
        </p>
        <p>From here, you can hover over the PiP window and set the stream to your preferred resolution:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Go_Live_-_11.png" style="width: 668px;height: 419px;" />
        </p>
        <p>All users can stream up to 720p/30fps.</p>
        <p>- Nitro Classic subscribers have access to 1080p/60fps.</p>
        <p>- And Nitro subscribers can go all the way up to 4k/60fps.</p>
        <p>Remember to <span style="color: #7b68ee;">invite your friends!</span> Similar to a standard invite, you can invite your friends directly to the stream or post the invite link.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #0000ff; font-style: italic;">Note:</span> <i>Keep in mind, if your friends join your voice channel and decide they want to Go Live themselves, they can also Go Live by following the same steps above!</i></p>
