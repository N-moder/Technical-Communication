        <h1>Sign Up for Nitro</h1>
        <p>Signing up for Nitro &amp; Nitro Classic is pretty simple as well. Go to your <b>User Setting</b>s page and locate the <b>Discord Nitro</b> tab.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Simply select either the monthly or yearly plan for Nitro &amp; Nitro classic:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/2.jpg" style="width: 868px;height: 897px;" />
        </p>
        <p>When signing up for the yearly plans, the "two months free" is in reference to paying $49.99/$99.99 for Nitro Classic/Nitro compared to spending $59.88/$119.88 @ the regular $4.99/$9.99 monthly rate. The yearly plans do not offer a free two month trial.</p>
        <p>This will open a new screen, allowing you to enter your payment info.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/3.jpg" style="width: 444px;height: 298px;" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/3b.jpg" style="width: 444px;height: 298px;" />
        </p>
        <p>On the next screen, enter your credit card information and other payment detail. Upon successful completion of the payment, Wumpus &amp; Co. will reach the destination, win the prize, and you'll be Nitro-charged and good to go.</p>
