        </p>
        <p>It's worth noting that Discord's core features <b>will stay free!</b> Group calls, making as many servers as you like, and all the fun stuff in between will never cost a dime.</p>
        <p>So what's in the package? And what’s the difference between Nitro Classic &amp; Nitro? TL;DR: <b>Nitro Classic has our classic chat perks, and Nitro has those same perks, plus exciting new perks and GAMES!</b> Yes, video games, to you, courtesy of Nitro.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16pt;color: #7b68ee;">NITRO CLASSIC</p>
        <p>Nitro Classic will bestow upon you the following power-ups:</p>
        <p><span style="color: #7b68ee;">1.Upload a Gif Avatar</span>: Nitro Classic will let you add some animation-y goodness to your profile picture. You can turn your still life avatar into a cool moving GIF, and it'll show up and do its magic tricks in text channels and all of your friend's servers.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #7b68ee;">2.Choose Your Discord Tag</span>: Customize your four digit Discrim when subscribed to Nitro Classic! Note, at the end of the subscription, your Discrim will randomize.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #7b68ee;">3.Use custom emotes everywhere</span>: While normally, custom emotes can only be used in the server that they've been uploaded to (with a few exceptions), Nitro will unlock your Kappa arsenal to be unleashed in every server and DM at your every whim. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility!</p>
        <p><span style="color: #7b68ee;">4.Higher Quality Screen Share</span>: Up your screen share game by being able to screen share games with 720p @ 60fps or 1080p @ 30fps.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #7b68ee;">5.Increase your file uploading cap from 8mb to 50mb</span>: Normally, you can upload individual files up to 8mb at a time, but having Nitro will supercharge your upload cannon into a 50mb force to be reckoned with.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #7b68ee;">Bonus</span>: You'll also get this sweet Nitro badge to show off to your buddies in your profile. Cool kid status.</p>

        <p>It’s our intention is to have these games available for Nitro subscribers as long as possible; however, how long a game is available is dependent on game developers/publishers.
