        <h1>Privacy Settings</h1>
        <p>Friends? Friends are great. Communities too. Things can get a little sticky when you get big bunches of friends and bigger communities, and some less-than-savory types join the fray. Luckily, we've been ramping up Discord's privacy settings to give you some control and up your hater-blocking game.</p>
        <p style="color: #7b68ee;font-size: 16pt;">SELECTIVE HEARING: DIRECT MESSAGE EDITION</p>
        <p>The first part of privacy settings is the Privacy Settings menu. Click the little down arrow next to the server name and you'll find this drop-down menu window:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In addition to being able to adjust notification and server settings, you can adjust privacy settings on a <b>per-server</b> basis as well. The choices are pretty simple:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/2B_.png" style="width: 540px;height: 249px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Selecting / deselecting this option <b>lets you block DMs (Direct Messages)</b> <b>from users in that server that aren't on your friends list</b>. Normally, sharing a mutual server is all it takes to allow DMs. This option can filter out anyone you don't want to hear from.</p>
        <p style="color: #7b68ee;font-size: 16pt;">BLOCKING&#160;OUT INDIVIDUALS</p>
        <p>In the case that you generally like everyone in a server (except for a few individuals), the DM list has a quick-access menu to a user's profile:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/bp3.png" style="width: 561px;height: 283px;" />
        </p>
        <p>In your DM chat, clicking the @Username will bring up the user's profile:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/3b_.jpg" style="width: 574px;height: 287px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can click the three dots in the top right to pull up a menu that will let you block the user.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/4b_.png" style="height: 287px;width: 650px;" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/5b_.jpg" style="width: 650px;height: 287px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="color: #7b68ee;">&#160;</p>
